Hello! This is my first Vue application, and I'm delighted to share my learning journey. It took me some time to grasp the syntax and understand the differences between Vue and React, but learning is always a joyful experience.

I have developed a handy map application with the following requirements:

1. Include a button that allows users to retrieve their current location from their browser.

2. Implement a search module that enables users to enter the name of a location. The search functionality should be triggered by both button clicks and pressing the enter key on the keyboard.

3. Display the searched location on a map and add a marker each time the location changes.

4. Create a table with pagination to present all searched places:
    
    a) Display a maximum of 10 records per page.
    
    b) Include a checkbox at the beginning of each row to enable users to select multiple records simultaneously.
    
    c) Provide a delete button at the top to remove all selected records and their corresponding markers from the map.

5. Show the time zone and local time of the most recent searched location.

Additionally, I have connected the Google Maps API for the first time, which required some effort to configure my dotenv file. I also encountered a slight challenge while removing the markers from the map, but I'm glad to say that I successfully resolved it. Enjoy the coding process!
